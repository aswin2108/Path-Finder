# Path-Finder
This is a path finding algorithm visualizer which currently uses A* algorithm for computing the optimum path between two points.
The colour changing node is the start node.
The red node is the end node
The cream nodes are the walls or obstacles.
The rest are empty nodes.
The  walls are generated randomly, so you can refresh to get a fresh layout.
Click the visualize button to start the process.
Now you can explore the app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Setup

Fork and clone the repo.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.<br>

## Future of this app

With time this app would be upgraded with more algorithms available for visualization like weighted algorithms and many more excited features would be there to play with. <br>
Stay tuned.<br>
